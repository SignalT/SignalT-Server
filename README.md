# SignalT-Server
Signal T standalone server for vehicles

# What is it?
### Signal T is a JSON-based protocol designed for vehicles.
The idea is to serve as a central hub for sensors and inputs/outputs in a modular system. It can be used, for example, in a caravan or RV to handle battery monitoring, temperature control, and more. Signal T can also read from and control third-party components within the vehicle, making it a powerful integration layer for smart vehicle systems.
